# nnprime
Requires boost libraries. I used 1.64

Makefile requires an export of $BOOST_INCLUDE which is the location of the boost library directory.
I know my makefile is lame, also I know I don't care. If you care, then fix it.

once the thing is made it can be run with. 

./runMirror parameterfile outputdata

paremeterfile is the name of the parameter file, if its not obvious. 
outputdata file is the outputdatafile, i really hope you figure this out on your own. 

The MirrorParameter.txt file is a good example of a parameter file, also it basically explains everything.

I included a python script to plot data, matlab script will come soon. that is what I will use so it will be more mature in the long run.
